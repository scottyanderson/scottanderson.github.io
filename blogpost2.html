			Second day of class and I must admit my mind is kind of spinning.  We were introduced to Git and Git Hub.  Setting up Git required , entering our terminal and instaling Git using Command Line Interface.  I am pretty sure at this point I didn't know up from down.

		 	I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere on the OC? What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese? What do you think about Sudden Valley? It sounds like a salad dressing, but for some reason I don't want to eat it. Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas.

			If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu. Do not order the Skip's Scramble.

			Taste the happy, Michael! Taste it! So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits.
