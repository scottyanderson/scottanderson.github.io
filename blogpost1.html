			This is my first day at front end programing class.  It is a blast and I am looking forward to all that I will learn.  However, first let me take a few steps back.
		</p>
		<p>

		 	Over that last few years I have tried to make learning code a proiety but I never seemed to make the time to do so; there was something else that I would put my attention towards. From time to time I would jump in, trying to learn but not knowing where to begin and how everything fit together.  I decided that if I were to learn how to code, I would need hands on training in a classroom setting.  I made it a goal to find out where such a class existed.

			I orginally heard about MakerSquare this fall while looking for sponsors for Product Camp Austin, where I serve on the board as the sponsor chair.  I reviewed their website and I knew that this was the school for me.   
		</p>

		<p>
			That takes me today.  I have just completed my first class and everything was great.  Mind is fully engaged firing on all cylinders remenicent of my excitement of learning how to snowboard as a kid. I really excited that I signed up for this course and didn't put it off.  I guess it is true, seek and you shall find.
